# junit-and-mociking-frameworks

We will use this work space to write all of the poc code we do for choosing mocking frameworks. 
We can simulate all of the use cases we have put across and evaluate all of the tools.

Junit Frameworks

1. Junit
2. TestNG

1. Mockito  -> which is probably the best
2. Powermock -> Good One
3. Easy Mock -> Need to check.
